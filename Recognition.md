Looking upon scientists' approach to the scientific method, I've identified a patternâ€”bias. Every new "grand theory" comes with its respective creator's bias. That is what was holding Science back.

So, I thought... how do we remove it from the equation? Oh, I know. What if we create an equation to get rid of bias? In every possible area? To cut incoherences from the start?

That was what led me to tackle this endeavor. Since I don't know advanced math, I used AIs to translate my ideas into proper equations and also relied on them to run validation tests throughout the process. I asked them to refine the equation every time it encountered a problem, without ever deviating from the original proposal: a mathematical equation, malleable enough to detect incoherences in every math-derived area, with just some tweaks according to each specific field.

I then used GitHub Copilot to translate it into proper Python code. And that's how we got here.

Some will say it was an astronomically improbable event. But so is intelligent life. We happened. The equation happened.
