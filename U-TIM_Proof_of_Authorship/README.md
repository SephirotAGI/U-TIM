Clarification on Commit History and File Integrity
Commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca (Original PDF Commit)

  On February 6, 2025, I made the original commit that added the first version of the U-TIM framework (U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf) to the repository.
  The content of the "U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf" file has remained unchanged throughout the history of the project.
  I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. If you see any discrepancy in the history or commit integrity, please feel free to contact me.

  The git log --oneline | grep 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca command does not show results anymore, since the commit was purged/rewritten because of a mistake I committed, following ChatGPT's commands blindly. So, please compare the results from the current 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca with U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

  It contains a snapshot from the commit days before I did this mess.

  Check the SHA256 hash provided in the U-TIM-archive.zip's PDF with the one available at https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

**What This Means for You:**

  If you’re concerned about the authenticity or integrity of the original U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf, I want to assure you that the file has not been modified. The commit timestamp and the file content remain intact.

**Commit History and Reversion Explanation:**

If you notice any discrepancies in the commit history or see that the commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca was reintroduced or restored, it's because I reverted to the original commit after it was temporarily removed. I did this to ensure full transparency and that no content was lost during the transition.

In Summary:

  The file content of U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf remains unaltered.
  There was no tampering or modification of the original file, and the commit simply had to be restored after a short-term removal.

**Next Steps:**

If you want to compare to the original 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca commit, please check U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

This can be further confirmed because the first commit from Thu Feb 13 is commit e7dd155e9b140a1a2546ade86649081fb050b92f , which says Restored deleted PDF from original upload commit. The exact prior commit, made  in  Feb 12, 2025, is 5b6e6e9f001e6087878f6f8b4b85245d63a8a171 , which simply updates U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/README.md

For comparison:

git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad" e7dd155e9b140a1a2546ade86649081fb050b92f
Thu Feb 13 00:00:02 2025 -0300

AND

git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad" 5b6e6e9f001e6087878f6f8b4b85245d63a8a171
Wed Feb 12 17:13:42 2025 -0300

Converting to UTC-2: Wed Feb 12 18:13:42 2025 -02:00

To be extra sure, run git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad %cd" <commit-hash> for them.

This command will output the Author Date (%ad) and the Committer Date (%cd) of commit, showing the same date and time


**Comparison from original commit:**

If you want to be sure, run git log -n 1 --pretty=fuller 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca
