Commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca (Original PDF Commit)

  On February 6, 2025, I made the original commit that added the first version of the U-TIM framework (U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf) to the repository.
  The content of the "U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf" file has remained unchanged throughout the history of the project.
  I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. If you see any discrepancy in the history or commit integrity, please feel free to contact me.

  Posterior note update:

In 2025-02-13, I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. By following ChatGPT's orders blindly, I accidentaly removed it from commissions history and put it back there. To confirm it's authenticity, please refer to U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

Check this link: https://web.archive.org/web/20250211060623/https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

It contains a snapshot from the commit days before I did this mess.

Compare the SHA256 hash provided in the U-TIM-archive.zip's PDF with the one available at

https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

As you can see, all commit hashes matches perfectly (Wayback Machine's, the one from U-TIM-archive.zip and the current one at GitHub), as well as their documents' SHA256 hashes, indicating that no changes were made.

I also thought that git "log --oneline | grep" served to see commit history of everything, not just the ones that were not deleted. Apparently, I was wrong.

And, please, don't you ever trust ChatGPT for important issues.

For more information about this mistake of mine, check "MisguidedByChatGPT.pdf" in my ArDrive. I also provided a ots file for it.

Commit 72e0cdab96e23bf0d4ecb9586f2044efc410eac6 , whose parent is 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca , is intact, with all links functional, which indirectly proves that 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca was put back in place with NO CHANGES MADE, as any changes in its content would change its commit hash. Link to 72e0cda: https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/72e0cdab96e23bf0d4ecb9586f2044efc410eac6

If you still got any doubts, refer to the initial commit: https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/796edba11b92293b28f411c657e3d2ed748e0684 . It is the proposal of the idea.

**What This Means for You:**

  If you’re concerned about the authenticity or integrity of the original U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf, I want to assure you that the file has not been modified. The commit timestamp and the file content remain intact.

**Commit History and Reversion Explanation:**

If you notice any discrepancies in the commit history or see that the commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca was reintroduced or restored, it's because I reverted to the original commit after it was temporarily removed. I did this to ensure full transparency and that no content was lost during the transition.

In Summary:

  The file content of U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf remains unaltered.
  There was no tampering or modification of the original file, and the commit simply had to be restored after a short-term removal.

**Next Steps:**

If you want to compare to the original 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca commit, please check U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

This can be further confirmed because the first commit from Thu Feb 13 is commit e7dd155e9b140a1a2546ade86649081fb050b92f , which says Restored deleted PDF from original upload commit. The exact prior commit, made  in  Feb 12, 2025, is 5b6e6e9f001e6087878f6f8b4b85245d63a8a171 , which simply updates U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/README.md

For comparison:

git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad" e7dd155e9b140a1a2546ade86649081fb050b92f
Thu Feb 13 00:00:02 2025 -0300

Converting to UTC-2: Thu Feb 13 01:00:02 2025 -02:00

AND

git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad" 5b6e6e9f001e6087878f6f8b4b85245d63a8a171
Wed Feb 12 17:13:42 2025 -0300

Converting to UTC-2: Wed Feb 12 18:13:42 2025 -02:00

To be extra sure, run git show --no-patch --pretty=format:"%ad %cd" <commit-hash> for them.

This command will output the Author Date (%ad) and the Committer Date (%cd) of commit, showing the same date and time


**Comparison from original commit:**

If you want to be sure, run git log -n 1 --pretty=fuller 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

It will show this:

diff --git a/U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf b/U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..ac03da0
Binary files /dev/null and b/U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf differ

Showing that the PDF was added for the first time, with no prior versions to it.

AND

git reflog 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

This will not produce output, meaning that no changes or alterations have been made to the commit via rebase or amend operations.
