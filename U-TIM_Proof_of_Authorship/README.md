Commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca (Original PDF Commit)

  On February 6, 2025, I made the original commit that added the first version of the U-TIM framework (U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf) to the repository.
  The content of the "U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf" file has remained unchanged throughout the history of the project.
  I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. If you see any discrepancy in the history or commit integrity, please feel free to contact me.

What This Means for You:

  If you’re concerned about the authenticity or integrity of the original U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf, I want to assure you that the file has not been modified. The commit timestamp and the file content remain intact.
  The new files I added just provide important information regarding citations and future licensing changes, ensuring that U-TIM remains open and accessible to everyone.

If you notice any discrepancies in the commit history or see that the commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca was reintroduced or restored, it's because I reverted to the original commit after it was temporarily removed. I did this to ensure full transparency and that no content was lost during the transition.
In Summary:

  The file content of U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf remains unaltered.
  There was no tampering or modification of the original file, and the commit simply had to be restored after a short-term removal.
