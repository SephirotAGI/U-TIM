IMPORTANT NOTE: Clarification on Commit History and File Integrity
Commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca (Original Commit)

  On February 6, 2025, I made the original commit that added the first version of the U-TIM framework (U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf) to the repository.
  The content of the U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf file has remained unchanged throughout the history of the project.
  I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. If you see any discrepancy in the history or commit integrity, please feel free to contact me.
