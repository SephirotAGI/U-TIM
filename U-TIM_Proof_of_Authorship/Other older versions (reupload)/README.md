This folder is for archiving reuploads of older versions, so people can see the logical process of creating the core equation (U-TIM).
From "U-TIM (version 3.1)-2-version first uploaded to Zenodo.pdf", which is named by "U-TIM (version 3.1).pdf" on Zenodo, until the latest version, everything is documented there (on Zenodo). Some versions on Zenodo were uploaded with the wrong "version tag" there (eg. Version v3 is actually the first upload of version 4.0), but from "Version v4" onwards, everything matches (Version v4 is just version 4.0 with a Validation Report).

Link to version 5.1 on Zenodo (the latest one until now): https://zenodo.org/records/14846098
