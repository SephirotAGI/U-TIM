# Legal Timestamp Proof & Clarification for U-TIM

## Timestamp Discrepancy Clarification

The Universal Theory Incoherence Measure (U-TIM)'s first PDF file (version 1.0), named "U-TIM (version 1.0).pdf", was uploaded in the GitHub repository  
under commit hash: **15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca**  
Direct link: https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca
**Commit Timestamp:** Thu Feb 6 **14:46:45 2025 UTC-3**  
**Converted to UTC:** Thu Feb 6 **17:46:45 2025 UTC**  

However, the document itself, generated within the same session, contains a timestamp  
of **"February 6, 2025, 17:44 UTC"** instead of **"February 6, 2025, 17:46 UTC"**. This is due to:

- The author's intent, at that moment, of using a standard UTC time, instead of the one from his respective time zone (UTC-3)
- The **absolute time equivalence between "14:46 UTC-3" and "17:46 UTC"**, confirming that  
  both timestamps refer to the same exact physical moment.

The **2-minute difference** between the document timestamp (**17:44 UTC**) and the commit timestamp (**17:46 UTC**)  
is explained by the brief time taken between generating the PDF and finalizing the commit.

**No modifications occurred between the PDF generation and the commit.**  
This statement is provided to prevent any misinterpretation of the time zone difference.
