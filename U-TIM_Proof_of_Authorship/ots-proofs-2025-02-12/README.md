# OpenTimestamps Proofs (Generated on 2025-02-12 UTC-3)

## Purpose:
This folder contains OpenTimestamps (`.ots`) files that cryptographically prove the existence of key documents related to the **U-TIM (Universal Theory Incoherence Measure)** project (U-TIM-archive.zip; commit_proof_v1_screenshots.zip; Traffic Â· SephirotAGI_U-TIM.pdf; Traffic_proof_screenshots.zip) **no later than February 12, 2025**.

These timestamps have been committed to the **Bitcoin blockchain**, ensuring an immutable, verifiable record of the documents' existence as of this date.

## Contents:
- `.ots` files: Each `.ots` file corresponds to a specific document that has been timestamped.
- These files can be verified independently using OpenTimestamps software.

## How to Verify:
To verify the authenticity and timestamp of a file, use OpenTimestamps:
```sh
opentimestamps-cli verify filename.ots
