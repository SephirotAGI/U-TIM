This folder includes screenshots proving that U-TIM was publicly accessed and cloned from GitHub on February 6, 2025, before the first Zenodo upload (version 3.1 on February 8, 2025). 

**What’s Included:**
- Screenshot(s) of GitHub Traffic Insights showing visitors and clones from Feb 6.
- Confirmation that U-TIM was publicly available before Zenodo.
- Temporary documentation; full traffic data will be uploaded later.

**Why This Matters:**
- This serves as additional proof that U-TIM was publicly accessible from my GitHub repository before it was uploaded to Zenodo.
- If any authorship disputes arise, this commit reinforces that my **GitHub commit timestamp (Feb 6) is the earliest verifiable proof of U-TIM's existence**.

**Next Steps:**
- When i get back home, I will have access to a computer and I will download the full traffic data and commit it as a secondary proof file.
