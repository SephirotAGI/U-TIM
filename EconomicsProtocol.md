Using that Dynamic Economic Threshold introduced at U-TIM Economic Thresholds (for version 5.1).pdf, consider the following:
Implementation Protocol:

  Baseline: Calculate both U-TIM(t) and ΘU-TIM(t).

  Decision Rule:

  If U-TIM≥ΘU-TIM → Immediate policy overhaul.

  If U-TIM≥0.15 but <ΘU-TIM → Warning mode (enhanced monitoring).

  Calibration Cycle: Re-estimate γ, δ, ζ every fiscal quarter using MCMC with latest data.
