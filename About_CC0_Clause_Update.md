# 📝 Why the CC0 Trigger Clause Was Updated

This document explains **why I, João Lucas Meira Costa**, made updates to the CC0 trigger clause for U-TIM, and more importantly, **why I am legally permitted to do so** under international copyright law and Creative Commons licensing principles.

## ⚖️ Legal Basis for Updating the CC0 Clause

### 1. I Am the Sole Copyright Holder

As the original and sole author of U-TIM, I hold full copyright and licensing rights under the **Berne Convention** and national laws such as **17 U.S. Code § 106 (U.S.)**. These laws give me the exclusive right to:

- Modify the licensing terms of my work,
- Prepare derivative works or updated frameworks,
- Set or change conditions for future licensing.

---

### 2. The CC0 License Was Conditional and Not Yet Active

While I have declared that U-TIM will transition to the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) License** upon my death or incapacity, that transition **has not yet occurred**.

Creative Commons makes a crucial distinction:

> “Creative Commons licenses are irrevocable **once granted**. However, you can stop offering your work under a CC license at any time if no one has accepted it yet.”  
> — [Creative Commons FAQ](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions)

The CC0 license is **conditional** — it is a **future trigger**, not a present license. As long as that trigger event (death, incapacity, etc.) has not happened, I am fully within my rights to update or refine those conditions.

### 3. Conditional Licenses Can Be Updated Until Triggered

My original declaration is legally equivalent to a **living intent** or **conditional clause** — not a finalized will or executed legal contract. Such conditional declarations are editable under international copyright standards.

Only **after the triggering condition occurs** does the CC0 clause become permanent and legally binding.

Until then, I retain full authority to:

- Add protections (e.g., against identity theft, clone replacement, executor elimination),
- Clarify terms (e.g., who may verify death or incapacity),
- Extend or redefine the legal verification process.

---

## ✅ Why This Matters

By updating the CC0 trigger clause:

- I am strengthening protections against abuse, impersonation, or coordinated suppression.
- I am reinforcing my intent that **U-TIM will remain free, forever** — under clear and uncorrupted conditions.
- I am being fully transparent about the **lawful and ethical basis** for these updates.

This ensures U-TIM is not only indestructible — but also tamper-proof.
