- **Any attempt to privatize, monopolize, or limit U-TIM after CC0 activation is a violation of the author’s explicit intent.**

- Any software that **incorporates, extends, or is fundamentally based on U-TIM** must be licensed under **CC BY 4.0**, which explicitly permits **commercial use**, provided proper **credit is given to the author**. This requirement applies **only while the author is alive**.  
- **Upon the author's death, all such works will automatically transition to CC0 (public domain), permanently removing attribution requirements and ensuring unrestricted use.**

## Section 3: Purpose of This Transition
This clause exists to **prevent monopolization and suppression of U-TIM**.

**The mission of U-TIM is to remain open, free, and accessible to all people, across all disciplines, forever.**  

By transitioning to CC0 upon the author’s death, U-TIM becomes **fully free and indestructible, ensuring its continued use for the advancement of scientific and economic truth.**
