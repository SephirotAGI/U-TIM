## Section 2: Automatic Transition to CC0 Upon Author‚Äôs Death or Incapacity

### Immediate License Change to Public Domain
Upon the **confirmed death or confirmed mental or physical incapacity of the author (Jo√£o Lucas Meira Costa)**, U-TIM, as well as any implementations of it,  
including **software, algorithms, computational tools, and all derived works**, shall immediately  
and permanently transition to the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) License (Public Domain).**

This means:
- **No individual, corporation, university, or government may impose restrictions** on U-TIM or any of its derivatives.  
- **All versions of U-TIM and any software, models, or research based on it** become completely unrestricted.  
- **This transition is automatic and irreversible.**

---

### Legal & Technical Mechanism for License Activation
This transition is considered **legally valid and enforceable** upon **any of the following confirmations:**

- **Public ORCID Status Update**  
  - ORCID-linked update or verifiable Zenodo/GitHub confirmation. [https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8564-9397](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8564-9397)

- **Official Government Death Record**  
  - A legal document confirming the author‚Äôs death.

- **Public Acknowledgment by a Trusted Executor**  
  - A previously designated executor or academic collaborator publicly confirms death or incapacity.

- **Legal or Medical Confirmation of Incapacity**  
  - A licensed authority declares the author mentally or physically incapable of acting or consenting.

- **Sustained Verified Absence**  
  - A complete and confirmed absence from all public, professional, and digital activity for **12 consecutive months**.

---

### üß¨ Identity Tampering or Substitution Clause

If a credible attempt is made to impersonate, replicate, or substitute Jo√£o Lucas Meira Costa through artificial, cloned, coerced, or digitally fabricated means,  
including but not limited to:
- Physical doubles or clones,  
- AI-generated avatars or deepfakes,  
- Involuntary coercion or forced silence,  

Then the **designated trusted executors** shall have the legal and moral authority to **publicly declare the author functionally deceased**,  
triggering the CC0 transition immediately and irreversibly.

---

### ‚ò†Ô∏è Executor Chain of Custody Failure Clause

If all designated trusted executors:
- Die,  
- Go missing,  
- Are declared mentally or physically incapable,  
- Or otherwise become unable to act, suggesting that third parties have acted with the intent to disrupt the verification process, suppress the CC0 transition, or eliminate oversight,

Then it shall be assumed that Jo√£o Lucas Meira Costa is **functionally deceased or incapacitated**, and CC0 shall be **immediately activated**.

This clause prevents bad actors from eliminating safeguards to delay U-TIM‚Äôs liberation.

---

### Once CC0 is Activated, the Following Applies:
- **All versions of U-TIM (past, present, and future) become public domain.**
- **No entity may impose new restrictions or claim exclusive rights.**
- **Any attempt to privatize, monopolize, or limit U-TIM after CC0 activation is a violation of the author‚Äôs explicit intent.**

**Full CC0 License Text:** [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

---

### Software Built Using U-TIM
This license applies to all derivative works based on U-TIM, including but not limited to **software implementations, algorithms, and computational tools.**

- Any software that **incorporates, extends, or is fundamentally based on U-TIM** must be licensed under **CC BY 4.0**, permitting commercial use with credit **while the author is alive**.  
- **Upon the author‚Äôs death or confirmed incapacity, all such works will automatically transition to CC0**, removing attribution requirements and ensuring **unrestricted, permanent freedom**.

---

## Section 3: Purpose of This Transition

This clause exists to **prevent monopolization and suppression** of U-TIM.

**U-TIM is designed to remain open, free, and accessible to all people, across all disciplines, forever.**  
By transitioning to CC0 upon the author‚Äôs death, incapacity, or interference, U-TIM becomes **permanently immune to control**, serving the **advancement of scientific and economic truth**.

---

## Section 4: Author‚Äôs Final Declaration

"I, **Jo√£o Lucas Meira Costa**, as the sole author of U-TIM, declare that upon my death, confirmed mental or physical incapacity, identity substitution, or complete executor failure, this work shall enter the public domain under the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) License**, ensuring that no entity‚Äîgovernmental, corporate, or otherwise‚Äîshall ever have exclusive control over it.

This declaration is intended to be final and legally binding **upon the occurrence of the specified conditions**.  
**Until then, I retain the right to revise this clause to further strengthen its protective intent.**

**‚Äî Jo√£o Lucas Meira Costa**
