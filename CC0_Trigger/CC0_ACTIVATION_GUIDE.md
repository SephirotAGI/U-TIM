# CC0 Trigger: U-TIM's Transition to Public Domain  

## Current License  
U-TIM is currently licensed under **CC BY 4.0**, which allows free use, adaptation, and redistribution with attribution.  
The official **active license** can be found in the main repository under **[LICENSE](https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/blob/main/LICENSE)**.  

For reference, an **exact copy** of this license has also been placed in this folder under **LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md**  
to ensure a historical record of the licensing terms at the time of publication.

## Future License (CC0 Activation)  
Upon the **confirmed death or verified mental or physical incapacity of the author (João Lucas Meira Costa)**,  
U-TIM — including all implementations, software, algorithms, and derived works — shall immediately and permanently  
transition to the **Creative Commons Zero (CC0) License (Public Domain)**.

This guarantees that **no entity—corporate, governmental, or otherwise—can ever claim exclusive control** over the framework.  

---

## How This Transition is Verified:

This CC0 transition is triggered by **any** of the following:

- **Public ORCID status update**  
  (Linked to Zenodo/GitHub. ORCID does not display deceased status publicly, but verification can be requested from ORCID Support or confirmed via Zenodo activity.)  
  Profile: [https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8564-9397](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8564-9397)

- **Official government death record**  
  (Legal documentation of death from relevant authority.)

- **Public acknowledgment by a trusted executor**  
  (A previously named academic collaborator or representative publicly confirms death or incapacity.)

- **Legal or medical confirmation of incapacity**  
  (Author is declared mentally or physically incapable of consent by certified professionals or court.)

- **Sustained, verified absence**  
  (If the author is entirely inactive across public, professional, and digital domains for **12 consecutive months**, confirmed by trusted third parties.)

- **Identity tampering or substitution**  
  (If trusted executors publicly confirm impersonation, AI-fabrication, or cloning attempts, the author is deemed functionally deceased and CC0 is activated.)

- **Executor chain failure**  
  (If **all** designated executors are killed, incapacitated, or disappear **in a suspicious manner**, this constitutes coordinated suppression and automatically triggers CC0.)

---

## Why This Exists:

- To ensure U-TIM remains **open, indestructible, and immune to control** — even in extreme or hostile scenarios.  
- To protect the work from **manipulation, censorship, or monopolization** by any party or system.  
- To guarantee that **scientific integrity and access cannot die with the author**.

## License Files:

- **[LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md](LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md)** — The active license file, archived here for reference.  
- **[LICENSE_CC0.md](LICENSE_CC0.md)** — The public domain license that takes effect under the specified conditions.  

---

**This transition is automatic and irreversible. Upon any qualifying event, U-TIM enters the public domain worldwide — permanently and without restriction.**
