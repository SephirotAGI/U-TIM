# CC0 Trigger: U-TIM's Transition to Public Domain  

## Current License  
U-TIM is currently licensed under **CC BY 4.0**, which allows free use, adaptation, and redistribution with attribution. The official **active license** can be found in the main repository under **[LICENSE](https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/blob/main/LICENSE)**.  

For reference, an **exact copy** of this license has also been placed in this folder under **LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md** to ensure a historical record of the licensing terms at the time of publication.  

## Future License (CC0 Activation)  
Upon the **confirmed death of the author (João Lucas Meira Costa)**, U-TIM shall immediately and permanently transition to **CC0 (Public Domain),** ensuring that no entity—corporate, governmental, or otherwise—can ever claim exclusive control over it.  

### How This Transition is Verified:  
- **Public ORCID status update (linked to Zenodo/GitHub). ORCID does not display deceased status publicly, but verification can be requested from ORCID Support or confirmed through Zenodo records. Profile: https://orcid.org/0009-0009-8564-9397**
- **Official government death record.**  
- **Public acknowledgment by a trusted executor.**  

### Why This Exists:  
- This transition guarantees that **U-TIM will remain open, free, and indestructible forever.**  
- No single entity should ever have the power to monopolize or suppress scientific truth.  
- The full text of both licenses can be found in this folder.  

## License Files:  
- **[LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md](LICENSE_CC_BY_4.0.md)** (An exact copy of LICENSE from the main branch, included here for archival purposes.)  
- **[LICENSE_CC0.md](LICENSE_CC0.md)** (Future license, which takes effect upon the author's death.)  

---  
**This transition is automatic and irreversible. Upon the author's death, U-TIM enters the public domain worldwide.**
