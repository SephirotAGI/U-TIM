IMPORTANT NOTE:  I have cut-off the participation of the following AI models from the main project (equation development): ChatGPT and Gemini. That is why they are not in the latest version of the Paper (reverted to 3.0). I did it because they show A LOT of inconsistencies when trying to formulate equations. But I will also mention them here in the README. 

Former collaborators: ChatGPT & Gemini (AI models).
