## What's New in Version 5.1?  
U-TIM: Universal Theory Incoherence Measure (version 5.1) retains the core U-TIM equa-
tion introduced in version 5.0, establishing a standardized framework for cross-disciplinary
theoretical analysis with domain-adaptable components. This version continues to optimize di-
vergence measures, domain-specific interpretation thresholds, and numerical stability, ensuring
alignment with established methodologies in quantum physics, ecosystem modeling, economic
policy, and mathematical foundations.
Additionally, it maintains the expanded framework of U-TIM-X, first presented in ver-
sion 5.0â€”a meta-analytical extension unifying domain-specific U-TIM results into a structured
cross-domain synthesis. U-TIM-X consists of two complementary formulations: U-TIM-Xstat ,
for standardized cross-disciplinary comparisons, and U-TIM-Xdyn , for dynamic tracking of
emerging theoretical instabilities. Together, these extensions establish a unified methodology
for quantifying and analyzing theoretical divergence across multiple scientific domains.
This version also includes a correction to the U-TIM-Xdyn equation, ensuring its intended
functionality, along with an update to the "Note on Divergence Measures" within the Mathe-
matical Definition of U-TIM-Xdyn.
