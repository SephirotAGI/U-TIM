ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTE: ðŸš¨
I have recovered the original version of U-TIM (1.0), along with its cryptographic proof of authorship, ensuring that the first publicly recorded version of U-TIM remains verifiable and immutable.

  This version was originally uploaded to GitHub under commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca on February 6, 2025.
  The SHA-256 checksum guarantees that this file is identical to the original.
  The full proof of authorship, including cryptographic verification and legal statements, is available at:

Posterior note (2025-02-13):

I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. By following ChatGPT's orders blindly, the git log --oneline | grep 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca command does not show results anymore, since the commit was purged/rewritten. To confirm it's authenticity, please refer to U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

Check this link: https://web.archive.org/web/20250211060623/https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca It contains a snapshot from the commit days before I did this mess.

Check the SHA256 hash provided in the U-TIM-archive.zip's PDF with the one available at https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

And, please, don't you ever trust ChatGPT for important issues.

## What's New in Version 5.1?  
U-TIM: Universal Theory Incoherence Measure (version 5.1) retains the core U-TIM equa-
tion introduced in version 5.0, establishing a standardized framework for cross-disciplinary
theoretical analysis with domain-adaptable components. This version continues to optimize di-
vergence measures, domain-specific interpretation thresholds, and numerical stability, ensuring
alignment with established methodologies in quantum physics, ecosystem modeling, economic
policy, and mathematical foundations.
Additionally, it maintains the expanded framework of U-TIM-X, first presented in ver-
sion 5.0â€”a meta-analytical extension unifying domain-specific U-TIM results into a structured
cross-domain synthesis. U-TIM-X consists of two complementary formulations: U-TIM-Xstat ,
for standardized cross-disciplinary comparisons, and U-TIM-Xdyn , for dynamic tracking of
emerging theoretical instabilities. Together, these extensions establish a unified methodology
for quantifying and analyzing theoretical divergence across multiple scientific domains.
This version also includes a correction to the U-TIM-Xdyn equation, ensuring its intended
functionality, along with an update to the "Note on Divergence Measures" within the Mathe-
matical Definition of U-TIM-Xdyn.
