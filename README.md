## What's New in Version 5.1?  
U-TIM: Universal Theory Incoherence Measure (version 5.1) retains the core U-TIM equation introduced in version 5.0, establishing a standardized framework for cross-disciplinary
theoretical analysis with domain-adaptable components. This version continues to optimize divergence measures, domain-specific interpretation thresholds, and numerical stability, ensuring
alignment with established methodologies in quantum physics, ecosystem modeling, economic
policy, and mathematical foundations.
Additionally, it maintains the expanded framework of U-TIM-X, first presented in version 5.0â€”a meta-analytical extension unifying domain-specific U-TIM results into a structured
cross-domain synthesis. U-TIM-X consists of two complementary formulations: U-TIM-Xstat ,
for standardized cross-disciplinary comparisons, and U-TIM-Xdyn , for dynamic tracking of
emerging theoretical instabilities. Together, these extensions establish a unified methodology
for quantifying and analyzing theoretical divergence across multiple scientific domains.
This version also includes a correction to the U-TIM-Xdyn equation, ensuring its intended
functionality, along with an update to the "Note on Divergence Measures" within the Mathematical Definition of U-TIM-Xdyn.

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT NOTE: ðŸš¨
I have recovered the original version of U-TIM (1.0), along with its cryptographic proof of authorship, ensuring that the first publicly recorded version of U-TIM remains verifiable and immutable.

  This version was originally uploaded to GitHub under commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca on February 6, 2025.
  The SHA-256 checksum guarantees that this file is identical to the original.
  The full proof of authorship, including cryptographic verification and legal statements, is available at:

https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/tree/main/U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship

Posterior note update:

In 2025-02-13, I tried to restore commit 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca, but with no success. By following ChatGPT's orders blindly, I accidentaly removed it from commissions history and put it back there. To confirm it's authenticity, please refer to U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/U-TIM-archive.zip, since it contains all metadata from this commit from no later than 2025-02-12 -02. To check this, verify the respective ots file: U-TIM_Proof_of_Authorship/ots-proofs-2025-02-12/U-TIM-archive.zip.ots

Check this link: https://web.archive.org/web/20250211060623/https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

It contains a snapshot from the commit days before I did this mess.

Compare the SHA256 hash provided in the U-TIM-archive.zip's PDF with the one available at

https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca

As you can see, all commit hashes matches perfectly (Wayback Machine's, the one from U-TIM-archive.zip and the current one at GitHub), as well as their documents' SHA256 hashes, indicating that no changes were made.

 

I also thought that git "log --oneline | grep" served to see commit history of everything, not just the ones that were not deleted. Apparently, I was wrong.

 

And, please, don't you ever trust ChatGPT for important issues.

 

For more information about this mistake of mine, check "MisguidedByChatGPT.pdf" in my ArDrive. I also provided a ots file for it.

My ArDrive, in case my GitHub suffers a forced takedown:

IMPORTANT UPDATE: I HAVE LOST MY SEED PHRASE TO THIS DRIVE, SO NO ONE, NOT EVEN ME, CAN MODIFY ITS CONTENT FROM NOW ON. FOR THIS REASON, IT WILL ONLY CONTAIN INFORMATION UNTIL VERSION 5.1.

Commit 72e0cdab96e23bf0d4ecb9586f2044efc410eac6 , whose parent is 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca , is intact, with all links functional, which indirectly proves that 15d8ccf6e40bf84791610acee139ba54aa1b32ca was put back in place with NO CHANGES MADE, as any changes in its content would change its commit hash. Link to 72e0cda: https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/72e0cdab96e23bf0d4ecb9586f2044efc410eac6

If you still got any doubts, refer to the initial commit: https://github.com/SephirotAGI/U-TIM/commit/796edba11b92293b28f411c657e3d2ed748e0684 . It is the proposal of the idea.
