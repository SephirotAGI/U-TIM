# U-TIM (Universal Theory Incoherence Measure)
A flexible mathematical framework to identify and quantify inconsistencies between models across domains (physics, economics, etc.). It provides a general structure adaptable with specific instructions.

I had to update the license, since there were two links to https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ on the same license.

Deleted previous PDF files, adding proper time-zone to the new version.
