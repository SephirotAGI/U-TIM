## What's New in Version 5.0?  
U-TIM version 5.0 updates the **core U-TIM framework** and introduces **U-TIM-X**, a meta-analytical extension that enhances cross-domain analysis by integrating domain-specific incoherence assessments. **U-TIM-X**  
comprises two complementary formulations: **U-TIM-Xstat** for standardized cross-disciplinary  
comparisons and **U-TIM-Xdyn** for dynamic tracking of emerging theoretical instabilities. Together, these extensions establish a unified methodology for quantifying and analyzing theoretical divergence across multiple scientific domains.

### U-TIM-X Extensions  
- **U-TIM-Xstat** â†’ Standardized cross-domain comparison of incoherence.  
- **U-TIM-Xdyn** â†’ Dynamic tracking of instability and emerging theoretical inconsistencies.  

Together, these extensions enable **comprehensive monitoring and synthesis of theoretical divergence across multiple scientific fields**.

## AI Re-Inclusion Notice  
In this version, ChatGPT and Gemini have been re-integrated into the main project. Their  
exclusion in previous iterations was due to incorrect utilization rather than inherent limitations  
in their capabilities.
