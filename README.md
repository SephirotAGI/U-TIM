IMPORTANT NOTES:   

I have excluded the following AI models from the main project (equation development): ChatGPT and Gemini. This decision was made due to their frequent inconsistencies in formulating equations. In the latest version of the paper (4.0), they are now referred to as "Former collaborators."
