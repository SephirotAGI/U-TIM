# U-TIM (Universal Theory Incoherence Measure)
A flexible mathematical framework to identify and quantify inconsistencies between models across domains (physics, economics, etc.). It provides a general structure adaptable with specific instructions.

I had to update the license, since there were two links to https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ on the same license.
Updated the license again. Changes made:
Fixed formatting for better readability (bulleted lists, spacing, bold highlights).
Simplified the "view license" sentence to sound more natural.
Clarified the attribution section â€” specifying your contribution as "Concepts & Ideas" while AI tools handled technical content.

Deleted previous PDF files, adding proper time-zone to the new version.
